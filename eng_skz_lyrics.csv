0,hellevator,My life was rock bottom  an edge of a cliff. I'm walking in a dark tunnel. Cruel and fearful days. I'm enduring through alone. The classroom hallways get farther away  I'm on unfamiliar paths. I'm so unlucky. On this path I'm on. I don't even have a map. But I never want to turn around. It's a maze. Shedding blood sweat instead of blood tears  I comfort myself. People tell me this kind of suffering. Is just a passing storm. That if I want to succeed  even though I'm afraid. I need to set up a trap called failure. As I bit on the bait that is pain. I'm wandering. As I put away my tired wings of passion. My life was rock bottom  an edge of a cliff. I'm walking in a dark tunnel. Cruel and fearful days. I'm enduring through alone. I hold out my hand. But no one is there to grab it. I'm riding on my pain and my tears. As I try to escape above. I'm on a hellevator. My hellevator. I'm on a hellevator. My hellevator. I'm on a hellevator. There's nothing. No one to care or worry about me. Only cold words. Telling me to give up on my dreams. Those quitting words keep hitting my ear. Only despair grows. The hopeful sky only gets covered by other people's hands. I'm praying to live as I try to endure. With the piercing eyes on me. I'm going insane. Even if I succeed. I'll be someone's clown. So people tell me to give up on becoming a singer. I'm getting weak. But I keep pushing myself. My life was rock bottom  an edge of a cliff. I'm walking in a dark tunnel. Cruel and fearful days. I'm enduring through alone. I hold out my hand. But no one is there to grab it. I'm riding on my pain and my tears. As I try to escape above. I'm on a hellevator. My hellevator. I'm on a hellevator. My hellevator. I'm on a hellevator. I'm trying to look for an exit. Take myself out from being trapped in the darkness. I'm fighting harder  run away from this place. I'm on the hellevator  I'm gonna go up. I'm escaping from my dark past. Shining on my path ahead. Tiresome times that drove me crazy. I'm running so I can forget. As the bell of a new start rings. I got on  hold my hand. And take me to the penthouse  my hellevator. I'm on a hellevator. My hellevator. I'm on a hellevator. 
1,grrrlawoftotalmadnessgrrr,Law of total madness. Grrr  my mind is a mess. Even if I'm like a violent ant. I don't care  I'll bark with anger. Leaving behind anyone who doesn't understand. Whether people view me in a good or bad light. It all feels uncomfortable  my frustration level is serious right now. In between mood swings  I'm at war with myself. Adult interference makes me even more restless. My current state  the way I talk  my actions. I know I shouldn't be like this. But everything goes the opposite way. I want you to understand me. I don't know what will happen. Again today  I'm barking. Don't talk to me. Whoever I see  I bark  I bite  I rip apart. Don't talk to me. I'm frustrated  so frustrated. Don't bump into me. After I bite  I'll chew and gnaw. Don't bump into me. Frustrated  frustrated  frustrated. Now I can't even sleep. My pillow should be soft but instead of a cushion. It's a mountain of books. I want strength to break apart this situation. But thousands of push ups don't help. I'm just going through some change. Adults who don't understand think I'm a delinquent. They try but they tire me out. I burn them up and eventually  they fail. My current state  the way I talk  my actions. I know I shouldn't be like this. But everything goes the opposite way. I want you to understand me. I don't know what will happen. Again today  I'm barking. Don't talk to me. Whoever I see  I bark  I bite  I rip apart. Don't talk to me. I'm frustrated  so frustrated. Don't bump into me. After I bite  I'll chew and gnaw. Don't bump into me. Frustrated  frustrated  frustrated. We rolling  we rolling. Till I run out of breath. We growling  we growling. We're turning into a monster again. Like a question without an answer. I can't get rid of my anger. My mind is not normal. I know but take it easy on me. This time only comes once in life. Even if I'm annoying. Just close your eyes on me once. How much more do I have to be lost. How much  how much. A million kilometers. Oh my  oh my  what is this . Oh my  oh my. A hundred million kilometers. Frustrated  frustrated  frustrated grrr. 
2,spreadmywings,I didn't wanna seem young. So I just kept changing clothes for no reason. I wanted to be an adult. So I watched the news for no reason. My eyes went from sneakers to dress shoes. Days that used to feel long now feel so short. As soon as the bell rang for break time. I used to run to the food cart. But now  my footsteps are pitiful and trembling. When I finally get my ID card. It'll be hard to hide my joy. All the times I acted like I couldn't act like a kid. As if I'm crooked yet straight. Acting like I'm busy even though I have time. Only my arrogance grew. I'm at the cusp of twenty. I wanna live my age  naturally ey ey. Fly with my young wings  spread my wings ey ey. It was nice when I acted like an adult. But I don't wanna change  even if they say I'm immature. Even if I'm bad at it  I like the word  beginning. It's foolish but i'm still young. It's hard to become an adult now. I'm afraid that the day I become an adult will come. The day I become an adult. I used to be a regular at the stationery store. But now I'm headed towards Garosugil. Rather than stopping at turning my eyes to nice things. There's poison in my eyes now. Acting like an adult  like I'm all grown up. Like I know what everything means. But now that the time is actually near  I don't know what to do. When the new semester started and I gathered all my books. I used to think it's too heavy. And put it down in front of the classroom. Now that I'm an adult. Responsibilities are even heavier. I'm not ready  only filled with worries. I wanna live my age  naturally ey ey. Fly with my young wings  spread my wings ey ey. It was nice when I acted like an adult. But I don't wanna change  even if they say I'm immature. Even if I'm bad at it  I like the word  beginning. It's foolish but i'm still young. It's hard to become an adult now. I'm afraid that the day I become an adult will come. The day I become an adult. I didn't wanna seem young. So I just kept changing clothes for no reason. I wanted to be an adult. So I watched the news for no reason. I won't do that anymore. I wanna live my age  naturally ey ey. Fly with my young wings  spread my wings ey ey. It was nice when I acted like an adult. But I don't wanna change  even if they say I'm immature. Even if I'm bad at it  I like the word  beginning. It's foolish but i'm still young. It's hard to become an adult now. I'm afraid that the day I become an adult will come. The day I become an adult. 
3,yayaya,Stray Kids. Watch out.     . Yaya yaya yaya. Yaya yaya yaya. Yayaya where are you going today . Yayaya what're you gonna do there . You're at the same place as the red carpet stars. The audience is filled with camera men. They all expect you to be careful. You need someone. I said  they the best  that's true  hurry and recruit them. The audience is in awe. When they see your killer stage. They see your stubbornness  your unseen madness. Your quiet endorphins  show me today. Don't be so cautious  like a headache. People suddenly disappearing. People suddenly leaving. But you don't go far away  every day. Hold me  hold my hand tight. Yayaya. You're so cruel in my dreams. Yayaya. When I open my eyes  seems like you'll disappear. Yayaya. I don't care  I wanna go to you and look. Yayaya. Say what. Yayaya. Ya verse  . I'm still afraid of goals with exits I can't see  no. I keep looking but I get lost  I can't believe myself. But still I'm running toward the dream  toward you  run. I can't hide my shaking eyes. All of my passion is out. Pop  pop  pop  pop  pop  popping charms. Dot  dot  dot  dot  put a dot on it. Busy every day  you're busy even today. Don't know where you'll go. You drive everyone crazy. It's been long since I've gone crazy  no expiration date. Your value is worth a national treasure. People suddenly disappearing. People suddenly leaving. But you don't go far away  every day. Hold me  hold my hand tight. Yayaya. You're so cruel in my dreams. Yayaya. When I open my eyes  seems like you'll disappear. Yayaya. I don't care  I wanna go to you and look. Yayaya. Say what. Yayaya. Who cares. I know I'm not good enough to have you. Who cares. I'm at an age to get lost in confidence. I'm not afraid of anything. That's a given. Can't nobody else do it like you. Baby baby ah. This is probably my greed. But I hope you'll hear this  watch over me till the end. I'm all ready. Every time I sleep  I think of being   . Skipping over everyone else. Whenever I wanted to run away out of frustration. You taught me one thing  there's no way. Yayaya. You're so cruel in my dreams. Yayaya. When I open my eyes  seems like you'll disappear. Yayaya. I don't care  I wanna go to you and look. Yayaya. Say what. Yayaya. One more time. Yayaya. You're so cruel in my dreams. Yayaya. When I open my eyes  seems like you'll disappear. Yayaya. I don't care  I wanna go to you and look. Yayaya. Say what. Yayaya. Say what. Yayaya. 
4,glow,We can rest but it's still too early. We need to rest but it's still so far away. The path we must go on. Even though we can't see the end  we must go to the end. On this path without a map. It's a maze  don't wanna look back. Only looking forward as we run. Shining through the darkness. Deng deng deng. Why is an alarm ringing at this time. It's time to get up  you need to get up. Feels like I just fell asleep  I just slept. I looked in the mirror  I look like a mess. We couldn't even dry our hair and left. It's a nice day but we're cool kids. Looking like we got rained on. Anyone can see we're one family  all afraid of being late. Everyone's busy running  but one fell down. Thankfully  only a small cut on his knee. No problem in dancing  even if there is  hold it in. If you're sleepy  cheat a little  slightly close your eyes. Practice goes harder once night comes. The maknae is whining  it's sad but we're hitting him hard. We wanna do my thing. Now the words  do nothing. Warns us and it stops us for a moment. Don't know any other way. Only looked at one place for a long time. So where do you want me to go . Look at the night sky  look at the stars. It's like us  shining brighter in the darkness. Going to work in the morning  coming back the next morning. After two or three hours of sleep with the hyung behind me. I go to work. Even if the fluttering feeling. Of my first day disappeared. My passion still overflows  hope it reaches you through this rap. Everyone's still busy running. But one fell down. Now instead of a small scar  emptiness remains. Days of silence flow. And then we all practice again. What will be the result of our practice . Asking this to ourselves in the studio mirror every day. Like a test error  seems like there's two answers. Top or the bottom  I don't know where we'll go. So much pressure behind the word debut. I can't handle this dream sometimes even though my future is dark. The lights in the studio shine brighter. The lights in my eyes turn on too. So I can find paths that weren't there before. Don't know any other way. Only looked at one place for a long time. So where do you want me to go . Look at the night sky  look at the stars. It's like us  shining brighter in the darkness. We can rest but it's still too early. We need to rest but it's still so far away. The path we must go on. Even though we can't see the end  we must go to the end. On this path without a map. It's a maze  don't wanna look back. Only looking forward as we run. Shining through the darkness. Don't know any other way  Imma get it. For a long time  gotta go. Only looked at one place for a long time. So where do you want me to go . Yeah  this is my last time  I won't give up. Look at the night sky  Imma show it. Look at the bright stars  gotta glow. It's like us  shining brighter in the darkness. 
5,schoollife,Nana nanananananana. Nana nana.  AM  the alarm goes off. The sunshine coming through the window. Mom nags at me to get up. Sounds like the mosquitoes on a summer night. My school uniform is wrinkled like my PJs. Wearing normal clothes inside  double layer. I wanted to sleep so I figured out. How to sleep while walking to school. Talking kid  reading kid. Taking care of his bangs and playing on his phone kid. As soon as the bell rings. The teacher scolds the sleeping kids. Teacher  you've been our age before. Why act like you don't know . Why you keep saying stuff . We kept complaining but only I'm getting mad. School bell goes ring ring ring. Feels the same every day  so sick of this. School life  again today. Wishing tomorrow would be a little different. School life  again today. Nana nanananananana. Nana nana. Again today. Nana nanananananana. Nana nana. Again today. Math class  battling with numbers again. The numbers that make me flutter. Are between    and  . Whether I have a dream or not  as if I'm an athlete. I run to the snack cart. No need to worry  throw em all away yeah. After school studies  school. My days are filled with studying  so annoying. It's not like I don't have dreams. But I'm always so small in front of grades. I can't do what I want. When I look in the mirror. So please stop. Send away your free spirit. School bell goes ring ring ring. Feels the same every day  so sick of this. School life  again today. Wishing tomorrow would be a little different. School life  again today. Nana nanananananana. Nana nana. Again today. Nana nanananananana. Nana nana. Again today. Again today. Feels the same every day  so sick of this. Wishing tomorrow would be a little different. School life  again today. Nana nanananananana. Nana nana. Again today. Nana nanananananana. Nana nana. Again today. Feels the same every day  so sick of this. School life  again today. Wishing tomorrow would be a little different. School life  again today. Again today. Again today. 
6,4419,How are you doing . Your spot next to me feels so empty. I try pushing back the unforgettable days. But I wonder how you're doing. I'm sitting at. The back of the bus  where we used to sit. Humming as I remember. The memories with you. I still remember the day I first met you. I remember we were almost the same height. We were the same age and we got so close. I know I still wanted to go to the end with you. Memories of fighting against each other. My friend  who comforted and helped me. I'll find my dreams  buy my ticket. Get to the station of debuts and cheer for you. How are you doing these days . It's fall soon  the leaves are falling. When you left  it was the hot summer. But your spot is empty like the winter. We're in different places with the same dream. Some day  we'll meet again in the same place. I keep thinking about our memories. In this small vocal room where we fought and talked a lot. How are you doing . Your spot next to me feels so empty. I try pushing back the unforgettable days. But I wonder how you're doing. I'm sitting at. The back of the bus  where we used to sit. Humming as I remember. The memories with you. Recently  I got to know a lot of people. It's been a while since I adjusted to this new place. I think I grew up a lot. I used to be afraid to go to the academies alone. So I begged mom for us to go together. But now I can go to Seoul alone. It's cool  I buy my own clothes now. We used to bond over comic books. But continuing to find that common interest as we grow up. Is an unrealistic comic  yeah. How are you doing . Your spot next to me feels so empty. I try pushing back the unforgettable days. But I wonder how you're doing. I'm sitting at. The back of the bus  where we used to sit. Humming as I remember. The memories with you. Thank you my friend  I won't forget you. I'll cherish all the moments with you. Thank you my friend  I won't forget you. Let's meet again in the same place. Trying to stop time to relive our memories. How are you doing . Your spot next to me feels so empty. I try pushing back the unforgettable days. But I wonder how you're doing. I'm sitting at. The back of the bus  where we used to sit. Deeply engraving our memories. In my heart. Thanks my friend. 
7,not,They say people are born different. But why does it feel like we're all the same. Us brainwashed into the same system. They expect perfection. So how can we be different. It wasn't until I saw my reflection. That's when I woke up and realized. That the truth had been hidden away from us. A sign  an omen  a  a GLITCH. Why is this suspicious world confusing me . Endless worries linger in my head. I feel even more trapped. Where am I  Who am I  I am not myself. I look at myself. But I realize I'm not myself. At that moment  I woke up. I'm not me. Why was I asleep for all this time . I'm not me. I need to wake up and escape now. From this place  where am I  A temple in my head. My house  it deceives me  I need to break this tempo. I'm trying to find something that's so vague. The more I slowly close my eyes  the clearer the light gets. Will I see myself in the darkness  I'm opening my eyes now.

When others see us  we're a bunch of delinquents. Changing that view. Isn't an easy solution. But we can't lose energy. Cause of the misunderstandings and bias. Our duty is to prove who we really are. They say  you're different from us so please leave. Fine but know this. Being different isn't being wrong. Soon  the time will come when people will get jealous. Our place is a district where a small light shines greatly on. Starting with   and in the end  it'll be everyone's refuge.

9,mirror,Where am I. Who am I. I am not me. When did it start  This problem that can't be solved. Who am I  It's homework that no one ever assigned me. Before I could memorize the formulas that materialized before me. I had no chance to decide on what answer to give. Without even knowing where I'm going  I'm just running. Cautious of the mirrors next to me. I'm just following. If I say it's because I'm still young. I think I'll get even more lost once I grow up. My confusion overlapping as I run  I keep pondering. Trapped in confusion  I still don't know myself. Do you know  Asking me  who doesn't have any answers. You make me cry  hold my hand. I'm in front of you  you're looking at me. Reflected in the mirror  I'm a maze. My insides are reflected in my mirror  no. Where can I find it . For once I wish I could see myself. I keep looking for it. I'm not me  who are you . I'm so different from the me I used to know. So many things I don't know  my dreams are only second. I don't even know how I feel so only tears well up. Every day  the situation ends. With either a question mark or three dots. I don't feel like myself but then I do. My heart is lost and the answer is hiding itself. I'm only looking for it. I can't touch it  my question is growing  but there's no answer. Trapped in confusion  I still don't know myself. Do you know  Asking me  who doesn't have any answers. You make me cry  hold my hand. I'm in front of you  you're looking at me. Reflected in the mirror  I'm a maze. My insides are reflected in my mirror  no. Where can I find it . For once I wish I could see myself. I keep looking for it.  I don't even know who I am. I just did as I was told in the memories. What is the path I must go on . Don't ask  just run first.  I don't even know who I am. I just did as I was told in the memories. What is the path I must go on . Don't ask  just run first. Who am I  I'm looking at myself but I can't figure it out. I am not  maybe I need to find a different mirror. How much more do I have to wander. Until I can look at myself and smile . What you want. What you want a mirror for myself. Reflected in the mirror  I'm a maze. My insides are reflected in my mirror  no. Where can I find it . For once I wish I could see myself. I keep looking for it.  I don't even know who I am. I just did as I was told in the memories. What is the path I must go on . Don't ask  just run first.  I don't even know who I am. I just did as I was told in the memories. What is the path I must go on . Don't ask  just run first. 
10,awaken,I don't feel good  there's something wrong. I saw myself for the first time. Who are you  I threw the question out there. Wake up. I wake up  this strange moment. Where am I  Who am I . Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . Shivers all over my body as if I was struck by lightning. Strange feelings. Pass through me one by one  I didn't know until now. I'm me  I'm me  I'm me. I'm me so what's the problem . I shouldn't  I shouldn't do this. What is this  Who is this . Wherever I go  you only hide. I follow you but you run away even faster. Don't know how to figure this out  confusion is only growing. I realized I wasn't being myself. A riot is happening inside me. Times I spent not knowing anything. I'm afraid  there's a voice ringing in my head. Wake up. I wake up  this strange moment. Where am I  Who am I . Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . Oh. I'm not me. Oh. I need to wake up. Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . I close my eyes and I can't see. But it's even scarier that I'm awake now. My question of who I am grows like a virus. On the path only I walked on  the fear scolds me  save me. Woo  I'm tired of the same life. Woo  I used to have the same way of thinking as everyone else. It was only hard and frustrating  I'm praying earnestly. What I've wanted so badly  awaken  hold my hand. Times I spent not knowing anything. I'm afraid  there's a voice ringing in my head. Wake up. I wake up  this strange moment. Where am I  Who am I . Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . Oh. I'm not me. Oh. I need to wake up. Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . Day by day  I'm getting scared. Someone answer me. After I woke up and opened my eyes. I felt a dizziness deep in my head. Day by day  I'm getting scared. Someone answer me. I was always filled with questions. What's the use  There's no answer. I open my eyes and look at myself again. But the answer is the same every day so I have nothing to say. Wake up. Oh. I'm not me. Oh. I need to wake up. Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . Oh. I'm not me. Oh. I need to wake up. Awaken  tears are falling. Who was I for all this time . Wake up. 
11,rockdol,Yeah yeah you know me. No no no that's not me man. If you wanna find me. Give me a shout out chyeah aha. I'd rather be. Rock or let me know me. Hey hey hey hey hey hey. Rock rock rock ROCK. I don't know I'm upset. Where can I find a clear answer . I'm so frustrated  I'm turning back again. So rather than living in this world. Filled with question marks. Being a rock that knows itself is better. Hide carefully  I might see you. Each day is the same  I'm trying to find myself again. Without worries  noise or rumors. If you keep chasing your tail  you'll find nothing. So I'm looking for a hint to myself again. You're so boring and irritable. But I'm so frustrated  I wanna go so I keep repeating this all day. I get mad mad mad. Getting burn up burn up burn up. And I'm swaying swaying again. I'd rather be. Rock or let me know me. Hey hey hey hey hey hey. Rock rock rock ROCK. La la la la la la la la la la la. If it's gonna be done poorly  better to not do it at all. La la la la la la la la la la la. If it's gonna be done poorly  then. Rock rock rock ROCK. Crazy  it's so hard. Crazy  back and forth. There are no worries when you're unconscious. That actually might be better. Humans with thoughts might be too much for me. The mind of my ego is filled with worries and anxiety. Clashing with confusion. Back to when I didn't know anything  before I turned two. How about I go back . It'll probably be better than right now. I don't wanna do anything. Reality is impossible. I just wanna dream of being a rock. I just wanna sleep. You're so boring and irritable. But I'm so frustrated  I wanna go so I keep repeating this all day. I get mad mad mad. Getting burn up burn up burn up. And I'm swaying swaying again. I'd rather be. La la la la la la la la la la la. If it's gonna be done poorly  better to not do it at all. La la la la la la la la la la la. If it's gonna be done poorly  then. Rock rock. I'd rather be. Rock or let me know me. Hey hey hey hey hey hey. Rock rock rock ROCK.

13,3rdeye,I close my eyes and I see with my  rd eye. Show me what you want   rd eye. I just wish I could see me me. I close my eyes and I see with my  rd eye I I. What is this  I don't know what's right. Feels like I'll know. But I don't know like a hidden camera. What I need is a  rd eye. It's my survival in this chaos. Is that eye sleeping. Or pretending to be asleep . Will I be able to awaken it . Or am I too scared to awaken it . Or am I on the other side. Closing my eye from being scared of the world's threats . Am I not able to open. Because the light is too bright . I know there is a part of me that I don't know. But I don't know what that is. I wanna find my keys that are hidden. So I can open my locked up eye. My  rd eye is wrapped around the chaos in my head. I'll give it a short kiss. Am I not able to open or do I not want to open . Like a chained and locked door. My eye is closed  tightly. I wanna know. I think I can know. Now the world that is folded in layers. But the truth inside. What am I  Who am I . What color is. The background of my heart . I close my eyes and I see with my  rd eye. Show me what you want   rd eye. I just wish I could see me me. I close my eyes and I see with my  rd eye I I. I don't want to be standing. And trembling in this nervous state. I want to check myself. I want that part of me. Don't close that eye  please don't close that eye. I'm trapped inside again. Don't shut the door  please don't shut the door. So I can get out  don't shut the door. I'm in front of the eye that can't open in this dark world. I can't see  I can only see the outer layers. That spread out before me. Just breathe in my heart. So I can open my eye some day. I know but I can't see. It's frustrating  please just once. Just breathe in my heart. So I can open my eye some day. I know but I can't see. It's frustrating  please just once. Open. Just breathe in my heart. So I can open my eye some day. I know but I can't see. It's frustrating  please just once. Open. 
14,mixtape1,Will I be able to go up. Will I be able to go up. Rather than deciding whether I'm on the right road. Or not. It's more of whether I want to walk on a fun road that I want. The medicine I was given to walk on this rough road. I know myself  and I'm relying to trust myself. Whether I'm under a delusion. No  or whether I'm just falling into a fantasy. Meeting the people I dreamt of in my dreams. Time to go  now my voyage begins. Honestly  the effectiveness of placebo. Has no effect  I've been deceived. I kept getting cheated while I had no confidence. Then find it and bring it here  I'm talking about inspiration. I see myself  then I want to see again. Just doing it  just wanting to do it all. Taking off the pessimistic filter. Changing it with sense of accomplishment. Even if I have no faith  I have to. Trust my self. Cause later when I become addicted to life. Honestly the medication I eat when I'm sick has no effect. But I'll go up  I'll fly. I'll head upwards yeah. It's all up in my mind. I'll deceive myself this time. I'll deceive myself this time. I'll deceive myself. Laying down restless. Regretting life choices. An anchor dragging me down like I always feel hopeless. But again I'm not the kind to fall in Devil's hands. Gotta drop my rusty chains  this is where I stand. This is my life  my time  won't stop. Thank God I'm back alive. Resurrected with the right mind. Believing myself all times  we gonna make it. Proud of ourselves we will never break into many ah. Optimism to heal myself when I get hurt. The placebo I'm using to continue believing in myself. Honestly speaking  there's no need for pessimism. Trusting in myself  throwing trivial thoughts away. When I'm trying placebo in my dream. I'll believe in going up one step by one step. I'll trust in this dream which doesn't move. Everyone is envious about the amount of my job. We can do it  with the need of expectations and trust. Cause later when I become addicted to life. Honestly the medication I eat when I'm sick has no effect. But I'll go up  I'll fly. I'll head upwards yeah. It's all up in my mind. I'll deceive myself this time. I'll deceive myself this time. I'll deceive myself this time. I saw it in my childhood dream. I trusted that I can find a happy image of me. The dreams that I dreamt. I trust that they will come into the happy reality. Cause later when I become addicted to life. Honestly the medication I eat when I'm sick has no effect. But I'll go up  I'll fly. I'll head upwards yeah. It's all up in my mind. I'll deceive myself this time. Oh yeah. It's all up in my mind. I'll deceive myself this time. It's all up in my mind. I'll deceive myself this time. I am able to go up. I am able to go up. 
15,who,I am WHO. I am WHAT. What's the reason for my real existence. Don't know why. Don't know why. Question  question. I continue asking  asking again. I can't find any answers. Tonight too  thinking through the night. Sleepless night  insomnia. Thoughts  thoughts piling up. Becoming a wall. I get scared looking at the wall slowly getting higher. This is the world's answer but it's not the answer that I want. Pouring countlessly. Voice  voice. I don't like being tormented. Noise  noise. How can I know where to go. Where is the answer  I'm finding for it. I lost my path to the answer. I lost my path like a lost child. I lost my path like a lost child. I am WHO.

19,insomnia,When the dark night puts everyone to sleep  when everyone's asleep. I can't sleep because of my countless thoughts. Hoping that I'll think of something. I wait till the morning sun wakes everyone up. When everyone turns the light off  when they're setting their alarm. When I'm tired  my worries open its eyes. Looking back at my day to see if it was good. Wondering what I'm gonna do tomorrow  then the alarm goes off. It's complicated but don't worry about it. Once you wake up  it'll all go away. They chase after me even in my dreams. But it'll all be forgotten. I try to forget but it comes back again. I don't wanna be caught up in this anymore. I try rolling up the blankets  I try screaming.

20,mia,No matter how hard you try. I don't think you're really smiling. Anyone can see you're feeling awkward. What's so complicated . You don't know though. You think you know. Something's different. I'm looking around you. We went to the amusement park while smiling. Made a lot of memories but. Something changed  something change. My past memories are frozen in time like Neverland. You used to tell me. Every little thing back then. But now I feel distant. I don't know why. I want to ask you. Something's different. It's not bad but it's awkward when I see you. Doesn't seem like you  I miss you from back then. I'm not used to seeing you changing like this. You're changing. No matter how hard you try to hide it. I can see everything. Feels like I'm talking to someone else. It feels awkward when I'm with you. Where did your pretty smile go . You used to smile so easily so I miss it even more. I can see everything  that awkward smile. You used to be so bright so I'm even more worried. I miss you I miss you. You  who used to happily smile. I can see you  I can see it. The you that I used to know that was so bright. What are you thinking about . Feels like you're spacing out. Often these days. Are you even listening to me . It's not you. Only I can see it through my tired eyes. Your childish simplicity has changed in a matter of a few years. It grew rapidly into complexity  torturing you. Lay down all those excess thoughts. I'm just saying out of worry  why are you glaring at me . Don't look at me with that face. With that dark face. If you make that face  will you get an answer . I don't want to be scared to look at you. I don't want to avoid your eyes either. So let's try to bring back the good days. No matter how hard you try to hide it. I can see everything. Feels like I'm talking to someone else. It feels awkward when I'm with you. I want to find the lost days again. I want to turn you back. Your words  your actions  your attitude have all changed. I can't even remember how you were before. Tell me how you were  I wanna know. You're changing with time. You know but you acted like you don't. Tell me what you want babe. Tell me what you want babe. I wanna see you again. Where did your pretty smile go . You used to smile so easily so I miss it even more. I can see everything  that awkward smile. You used to be so bright so I'm even more worried. I miss you I miss you. You  who used to happily smile. I can see you  I can see it. The you that I used to know that was so bright. 
21,awkwardsilence,Let's smile first. Let's just smile. If you cry then laugh  they say you'll get a horned butt. Let's just pretend to be deceived and smile. Words that compare you to others. Words that don't understand your heart. All of those little things. Don't let it ruin your precious day. There's no reason for that. Don't be so serious like a red light. Just stop whatever is around you. Don't make silence flow. That's no fun and time's too precious. Oh my gosh  look at him he's so depressed. Stop frowning  you're gonna get wrinkles like a caterpillar. I know everything's so annoying but. Like awkward silence. A crow is passing. No need for the vibes to grow sour. Just be cool. It's not easy to just laugh it off baby. But don't make your bright face so dark. It doesn't suit you  it's no use. Hey  hey  pop  pop. Let's be more flexible. Why make things awkward with one word . No need for feelings to get sour. Ignore all those words  don't care about it. Why do you look like you're gonna cry . Let's smile  you're gonna get wrinkles. Even if you laugh it over  each day isn't enough. So let's not joke around with emotions. Oh my gosh  look at him he's so depressed. Stop frowning  you're gonna get wrinkles like a caterpillar. I know everything's so annoying but. Like awkward silence. A crow is passing. No need for the vibes to grow sour. Just be cool. It's not easy to just laugh it off baby. But don't make your bright face so dark. It doesn't suit you  it's no use. Hey  hey  pop  pop. What're you gonna do if you're not in a good mood . Go out and eat beef . Flower marbled sirloin. You feel better after a full stomach. And you'll go to Garosutgil with your friends. Shopping shopping shopping. What're you gonna do if you're not in a good mood . Go out and eat beef . Marbling. You feel better after a full stomach. And you'll go to Garosutgil with your friends. Fashion. Lalalalala. Everybody sing. Lalalalala. There you go mate. Lalalalala. Let me hear you say. Lalalalala.

22,mixtape2,I remember the day we all first met and said hello. Our practice sessions were like babies on walkers. Like mothers making baby food. We paid attention to all the details. Compared to that passion. People's reactions are impossible. If we were to react to that zero reaction. Our scars would have severely reacted. This song probably wouldn't exist either. We were just thirsty for a bit. Feels as though we forgot those butterflies back then. In other words  seems like we've become quite reliable. Compared to before. Feels like we've been chased by time and have lost. It's too much to be stubborn like ticks. Even with the insecticide. That is the end. I can't press down on my dreams. Even if my future is bleak. My passion becomes my lamp and casts a light before me. When nine come together. It becomes a lighthouse and the situation changes. Don't close your eyes again. There's a shadow where the light shines. When you turn around. A bright light will be waiting for you. Am I doing right or not. Honestly  I was nervous back then. But now  there are so many flowers shining on the nine.  There are flowers . So I'm not unsure anymore. One for the fame  one for the game. I don't care when  just like them. One for the way  I'm gonna take. Wherever you are  sing this song. Even if it gets farther away. I can't stop. Even dark shadows. Only exist with light. We've all only looked at the light and came this far. The brotherly love of us nine  connected by music and dance. I don't regret it  even though I'm a bit tired. I just like to eat chicken and laugh and have fun. The black and white prepares the world. Following it like crosswalk. I'm living a life that has no choice but to do so. Let's just comfortably laugh. Just think simply. Just work hard. Eh  we never give up  yeah  yeah . We never give up  yeah eh. We never give up  yeah eh. Won't ever give up. Oh  I believe my family. A light shines on us so we can overcome it all. Even if shadows swallow us. We won't give up. I wake up  my happy dreams fade away. I can't breathe  it's so complicated. Same actions keep replaying. I can't feel it even after time. In my head  colorless voices. Stepping in my heart  hopeless choices. I know I can't succeed if I feed like this. Leave like this. Scarred and feared pain like this  yeah. One for the fame  one for the game. I don't care when  just like them. One for the way  I'm gonna take. Wherever you are  sing this song. Even if it gets farther away. I can't stop. Even dark shadows. Only exist with light. I go through that too. But when things are hard  I look at the sky. It can't always be light. But only when darkness comes. Can it get brighter. So think again  no . Look back at the path you've taken  I can't . Suddenly  you're this far. You came too far to give up. Hard times will always pass. Throw away your worries. Fly to the sky. One for the fame  one for the game. I don't care when  just like them. One for the way  I'm gonna take. Wherever you are  sing this song. Even if it gets farther away. I can't stop. Even dark shadows. Only exist with light. One for the fame  one for the game. I don't care when  just like them. One for the way  I'm gonna take. Wherever you are  sing this song. Even if it gets farther away. I can't stop. Even dark shadows. Only exist with light. 
23,you,A lie without an answer. Don't be fooled  it's a lie. Take off your confusion  throw it away. Cause I can see you now. Yes  you. In my head is a wandering question mark. I sigh out of frustration. Now I found you and it becomes a period. My heart naturally sighs of relief. You. Yeah I am you. You. Yeah I am you. You. I am you. You. I am you. 
24,iamyou,You filled up my emptiness. Only you could fill it up. Just by being by my side. You gave me strength. I couldn't say anything else but thank you. But now I'm reaching my hand out to you. With you  who has taken my hand. I can shout of a bigger dream than before. If I can live for you  I can do anything. If you can shine brighter  I can be the darkness. I'll stay by your side. Will you stay in the same place as me . It's too cold to be alone outside. You're here  so it's getting warmer. I am YOU  I see me in you. I know when I'm with you. In the same place  in the same time. I can overcome anything. I found YOU  I found me in you. I can see me in you. In the same place  in the same time. Let me run  let me run  let me run along with YOU. You shined on me when I didn't even know myself. I didn't know and I was lost. But from some point  I saw through the window. Because you spent the same time  the same day with me. Now my questions and your answers. Fit together like a puzzle. My worries and your worries. Intersect. Our chemistry is like a fantasy  every moment. Is so perfect when we're together. Through you  I see me and through me. You see yourself  such a great scene. I'll stay by your side. Will you stay in the same place as me . It's too cold to be alone outside. You're here  so it's getting warmer. I am YOU  I see me in you. I know when I'm with you. In the same place  in the same time. I can overcome anything. I found YOU  I found me in you. I can see me in you. In the same place  in the same time. Let me run  let me run  let me run along with YOU. Yeah stay by my side. Yeah I need you right by my side now. Will you be on my side  Let's run with our footsteps in sync. We're going side by side  I wanna go with you. Promise me. I see myself in you. Stay together. You and I  you and I  you and I  I'm by your side. Always  going toward the same place as you. You and me  you and me  you and me. Can't compare you with anyone else. Stay together. You and I  you and I  you and I  I'm by your side. Always  going toward the same place as you. You and me  you and me  you and me. No one can replace you. I am YOU. 
25,myside,I hope you'll hear the lyrics of this song. The lyrics for you won't flow away. And will be there for you  stay. Too many days I was up all night painfully. Whenever I was doing so  you gave courage to me. Even if we saw the same fearful future. You put my dream first. Thank you for reaching out your hands. I feel empathy I want to lean on you. Stand by my side. I start to open my mind  remove my anxiety. Hold my hands quickly. No need to separate each other. If we gather  we help each other. Everything you say by my side. Relieves me so much. Fire a flare pop  pop. We can't see the way we're frustrated. If you can see this light  please come to me. Like a flare in the air  bring us back again. I think I'm still young I'm afraid. I don't want to keep the word 'alone' by my side. I hope you'll hear the lyrics of this song. The lyrics for you won't flow away. And will ring in your ears. You came to me for no reason. If I'm not there for you  I'll be on your side. I'll go see you soon. If I'm left alone  I think I know the temperature of the feeling. I feel warm only by the fact that someone is by my side. When I make steps alone. I feel awkward as if I'm on a shoe. That's why I need someone on my side. A pair of shoes rather than a shoe. Even if I got sensitive and bad tempered. You became the shield. You let me finish and always there for me. You were on my side. I'll do everything  the resolution. Will come true that I made it. If you're ready to achieve your goal. Make a resolution  be on my side. Fire a flare pop  pop. We can't see the way we're frustrated. If you can see this light  please come to me. Like a flare in the air  bring us back again. I think I'm still young I'm afraid. I don't want to keep the word 'alone' by my side. I hope you'll hear the lyrics of this song. The lyrics for you won't flow away. And will ring in your ears. You came to me for no reason. If I'm not there for you  I'll be on your side. I'll go see you soon. I'll be on your side I'll trust you forever. I promise you  stand by your side.

I will definitely never give up. This is our start line  our start line our start line.       it's our start. 
30,mixtape3,My steps toward the study room. Today as always. Are not just light. The tedious hours that started again. Let me down and make me watch the clock. Sometimes  I think if I can do well. The moment when I gave it a shot as much as possible. And when I accomplished. I exist in between  shall I make efforts . Don't worry. The way you've run is just a process for you. Flowers too. Have the process  not the moment in bloom. That's more beautiful. The real time spirit and mind. It's only natural that you're confused. It's a process to make good results. You've took so many tests. This is not different  it determines your life. That is an exaggeration  so don't worry  you're doing fine. We're still young I don't think it's the last one. We suffered in the past But we cheered ourselves up again. You endured the hardships and adversity. Keep believing in yourself. Yeah I know  we know. You can do it well. Don't give up. You've done so well. What are you worrying about  Believe in yourself. Blessings wait for you  hey . For you  hey . You must have suffered a lot. Living as you tried to be awake. Time must have passed a lot. It's on your face. You lost and won in the battle. With the numbers for      days. Get out of the room that locked you all night. You really did a good job. Let's only walk on the flowery path. I've run without a break In the repeated tension. I chose a path that's not easy. To make flowers bloom  they have to go through the winter. I hope I can see the fruits of the flowers. I'm nervous and afraid. Solve the problems on time and watch the time. Tick tock time is still left. Ring ring it's ended but I have many worries. Just please stop asking how I did it  leave my business. Cause ma markings on my papers. Tell me that I'm really useless. But again I'm just getting started. There's always other ways. Gotta fill up my story  this is my buffet. Yeah I know  we know. You can do it well. Don't give up. You've done so well. What are you worrying about  Believe in yourself. Blessings wait for you  hey . For you  hey . I don't know the feelings yet. Somehow I think I know the feelings. It's okay you can do well. The word gives me a lot of energy. The last rite of passage before folding the young wings. The footsteps I've left. Where will they go . I think the records for my days. Became the foundation for my future. It ain't over. It ain't over. It ain't over. What are you worrying about  Believe in yourself. Blessings wait for you  hey . For you. Blessings wait for you  hey . For you.

33,mazeofmemories,Time runs. Like my dreams  day and night. I'm carrying them on my neck. Throwing my memories outside. This is like a drama without a script. It's an ending you've never thought of. The dust that covered my heart before. Now presses down on my dreams. Throwback  swallows up the dark night. Now I have the bright light of the sun that I took. Next  in the cold dawn  I see the lonely moon. It covers my face  intoxicating me. Like it's coloring me black. My head is burning. Question marks filling me up  blaming myself. Now I'm running for an answer I can't even see. Running on my mind but I'm feeling even more frustrated. This is a fight for my tomorrow. Right now  I feel like I've seen the future from yesterday. I'm putting on a smile  letting out a sigh. Feels like I'm taking a look at myself. A momentary silence. The slower I walk  the more the wind pushes me. Turn up with this wandering. Give me some time to sleep. Show me an answer that's like the wrong answer. What I see right now is all a lie. I go around but I'm stuck in the same time. Under the blue sky  our song burns red. Our song burns red and the sandy wind tries to stop it. Like a whale hunting for food. But I can't just get eaten  that's how I am. When stones come flying from here and there. I'll cut them up with a sword. Turning them into pieces  making the pieces into a mountain. And giving it all back. It's boiling up  the anger I held. I'm lifting myself up from being trapped in anger. I wish that anger would bloom into a flower. Instead of a sea of fire  I want to be in a bed of flowers. Devils chattering above the highway. My brain floats around the complex air. What saved my brain are the birds that fly high. I'm riding on the back of those birds  flying. Mma look back. Imma look back to the future in fact. Let me examine the progress. The demons that tried to suffocate the road to success. Imma look forward into the sea. Oblivious sea I call  history . Thunderous waves that rage. Destroying the maze of memories I wanna see. And so  should I give up. But really  can I give up. We live in a time and space  a world full of blinds. It makes me wanna give up. But then again  no I shouldn't give up. I feel it inside  don't wanna give up. We live in a time and space  a world full of blinds. Now I've had enough. Calling out for help  on this carousel. Life is like a dare or an open fair. I just wanna tell  tell the citadel. Dream. Empire  campfire . Unpile old files  set fire. Rise higher  go wild and chase my. Dream. That's why I. Never give up. Never give up. Listen to me  I'm different. Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Looking at tomorrow  running a bit more. Never give up.

36,19,This is too fast. I waited for this moment  how about you . Are you scared  Or excited . Actually  it hurts me to let you go. Every time a day felt slow  I prayed it'll go by quickly. But now I feel the opposite. I wish this moment would stop for a bit. Time  don't stay here  go away for a moment.          once again  back to the   . Now we became the artists we wanted to be back then. I still can't believe it but I'm happy. Because I had a lot of luck with my dreams  I'm satisfied. But even before I started to dream. I was excited for this moment. I wanna stop time for a moment. I'm not even ready yet. My twenties are waiting for me from far away. Why. Do the days go by so quickly . If I count to three right here. What if everything disappears like a dream. And I'm back to the beginning . Back  back  back  back  back  back. Back to the past. When I used to fret fret fret fret. Every day. If this moment passes  what if it gets far away . What if I never see the me of right now again . I just wanna go. Back  back  back  back  back  back. Back to the past. Now the way I talk is more grown up. Still a bit inexperienced  but I'm walking like I'm confident. Like a middle school student acting like a grown up. I'm still immature  not used to anything. I was used to seeing adult only zones after   PM. Now it doesn't matter anymore. But what do I do  My parents still view me as a baby. Strangely  I'm still used to it too. Pay attention  how old are you to fret again . Soon  I won't be a minor anymore. This is enough. It's natural  keep going. Stop being so uncomfortable  everyone went through this. I always wanted to turn   . I'm going through the same thing as everyone else. But why am I the only one so nervous . Or maybe other people close by like my mom  dad and brother. Maybe they all went through this too. Why. Do the days go by so quickly . If I count to three right here. What if everything disappears like a dream. And I'm back to the beginning . Back  back  back  back  back  back. Back to the past. When I used to fret fret fret fret. Every day. If this moment passes  what if it gets far away . What if I never see the me of right now again . I just wanna go. Back  back  back  back  back  back. Back to the past. This awkward place. Is now my home. Seoul used to feel so big. Now it feels so small. I landed here with a dream. Now I'm looking out the window  preparing to take off. I landed here with a dream. Now I'm looking out the window  preparing to take off. It was so awkward. It used to feel so big. It was so awkward. It used to feel so big. 
37,mixtape4,Hundreds of different paths always without a solution. Confuses me with the unlimited extent. Read others' feelings by tilting my head not to look different. For fear of blushing if I take the wrong path. At some point music started to intervene in my path. And control me. I picked a new path and did as I want. When I failed  I stood up again. To those who thought I gave up  I stick out my tongue. Without knowing where the treasure island is. Lots of reefs during the long voyage in the open sea. I find my dream with a compass. Without comparing to others  I'm getting closer to my dream. When I'm asked where I want to head for. I don't have the answer. Aimless sailing. I should stop wandering. When the doubtful needle of my compass. Turns round and round. Whether it's against its will. It follows the sense of direction of others. When others follow that  I won't. Even if they call me a clown. Even if my compass looks broken to them. I move at my own will A real life Jack Sparrow. This spot where I'm floating. Has never been visited anyone by sailing. On the deep and dark ocean. I was afraid because it was the first time. When others drift away. We'll go against the current. Sailors wandering the ocean. Hoping to be a captain. Music is the ocean. I'm not lonely even if others turn away from me. As long as I stay with my heart. I lean on the broken compass yeah. I'm floating under the moon in the dark night. Will the stars and the moon show me . Where's my sailing heading for . Don't I have confidence of an exclamation mark. Rather than a question mark . Pull yourself together don't give up. Where you're heading for is right. Whatever it is  trust your choice and just follow it. You can do it I believe you and trust you forever. Even if I'm swept by the endless current. Don't stop  go forward on my path. Even if I can be swayed  I'll never be broken. Keep looking up to the sky. I be dreaming high up in the sky. Without direction  follow the wind comfortably. Trust us and go into the clouds  just gotta fly. Sail across the world  this is our time. Stray Kids   or none. We're gonna cross the finish line. No stopping time when all we see are goals in our sights. No turning back  push forward  rise above the light. This spot where I'm floating. Has never been visited anyone by sailing. On the deep and dark ocean. I was afraid because it was the first time. When others drift away. We'll go against the current. Sailors wandering the ocean. Hoping to be a captain. Music is the ocean. I'm not lonely even if others turn away from me. As long as I stay with my heart. I lean on the broken compass yeah. I often walk alone. The empty ocean and desert. Looking for a road  got no place to go like. I can't see anything. It's been a year and it's true now. Call me captain  I'll do it for my crew now.      that's when I started. My precious team is my compass. Even if other ships are busy moving. Only with my compass on my hand. In this wide ocean endlessly unfolding. I'm getting closer to the goal slowly. There are lots of things I can see. Only here  don't regret. Yes  only if I endure. I can see everything I dreamed. When others drift away. We'll go against the current. Sailors wandering the ocean. Hoping to be a captain. Music is the ocean. I'm not lonely even if others turn away from me. As long as I stay with my heart. I lean on the broken compass yeah. 
38,roadnottaken,Wandering around. It's a little confusing. Freeze  panic again. A frustrating situation. I'm walking trusting the compass. But there's a familiar scene. I go on a path that has never been stepped on. Not the main path but my own. Even if I can't see the future  I'll step out. Throw me without fear. Run and run without a regret. Even if it's suffocating  I will never stop. Even if it's suffocating  I will never stop. Even if it's suffocating  I will never.

My fighting spirit overflows  I thought I could beat everyone. But not even my rashness can help me endure. Maybe it hurts more because I thought it'd be easy. I used to shout out. I wouldn't change. But why am I changing endlessly. Depending on my surroundings . Why do my reactions change. Depending on whoever just passes by . I used to bop my head if I liked the rhythm. But now I'm doing it cause I'm following someone else. What if my personal tastes change too . My head hurts. My head hurts. My head hurts. I'm swallowing a pill that gives me baseless confidence.  Gulp gulp . Did I take too much  Now I have more worries than courage.  Tremble tremble . Everything's changing  from   to     everything.  More and more . Without my intention  the side effects keep coming. No no no no. Wait  this is strange  it's getting blurry. Why isn't this ending  I keep hearing that anxious sound. Even from here.

40,tmt,The night when all sorts of thoughts come to my mind. As usual I look up to the night sky. As there are more stars twinkling. Why do I get more nervous and anxious  Yeah. As if the stars. Are looking down on me  I feel bad these days. Should I follow the blowing wind . Am I left behind facing the headwind . Not anyone can do this. I shout out every day that I'm not anyone. I know my situation and circumstances. But I keep on going this way. No matter how much I walk I still remain in the same place. Treadmill. This d j  vu is unwelcomed  it distresses me. The two different paths between crisis and opportunity. Is the one that I've been on a crisis . Pretending not to know I keep asking. I want to be like the twinkling star. Not everyone can be a star Bling bling. I'm afraid of falling. Like the falling stars. I guess I'll never ever find out. All sorts of thoughts come to my mind. Should I go or not  Yah. All sorts of thoughts come to my mind. I have all sorts of thoughts in my mind. Why am I wandering even if I chose my path . I ran looking at the star. I feel hopeless about my path so I'm scared again. Can I be like that star . Have I come too far  Yeah. It's the same even if I look back Yeah. In darkness I've walked. By relying only on the shining star. I know I've been walking this way. Based on my will and choice. But I keep looking elsewhere. Are these my lingering feelings  I know it shouldn't. But I'm afraid that it will turn into regrets. Ey Who would challenge knowing that it's impossible . I often get hurt after coming in. But I pretend working hard If I step backwards. Will somebody blame me. For being irresponsible . The path I've been on looking upon the star. Fades away in the dense forest silence. I'm afraid that the star I've been watching. Has already fallen like a meteor. I want to be like the twinkling star. Not everyone can be a star Bling bling. I'm afraid of falling. Like the falling stars. I guess I'll never ever find out. All sorts of thoughts come to my mind. Should I go or not  Yah. All sorts of thoughts come to my mind. I have all sorts of thoughts in my mind. Honestly this is my choice. But I feel nervous about not being able to do it as I wish. Only the expectations for me grow bigger. I'm afraid to fall down if I rely on more. Woah  Hey . Shall I turn back . Woah  Hey . Don't look back. Should I go or not  Yah. I have all sorts of thoughts in my mind. Why am I wandering even if I chose my path . I ran looking at the star. I feel hopeless about my path so I'm scared again. Can I be like the star .

43,levanter,I thought I could reach if I kept chasing. I've never even doubted. Even though I held you as I imagined. Even though I held you tight with two hands. In my arms only the emptiness remains. By wandering around. I finally realized. That I have to let go of you.  Oh  I've been deceiving myself.  Oh  The moment I wake up from the dream I've endured.  Oh  I feel the light flooding in. I wanna be myself  I don't care . Even if it's still strange  Just don't care . As soon as I broke away from you  I can see myself. Everything  all before my eyes. Now I know  Now I know . The one I needed has been me. I walk as my feet take me. I feel the light  I feel the light. I was constantly running to you. Then I realized. That my everything was towards you. The more I got close to you. The more I lost myself. Like the fallen leaves under the tree. Even if I eventually get stamped on in the snow. Now I rise above you looking for the spring. The remaining feelings are blown away by the wind.  Oh  The tunnel that locked me up in the dream.  Oh  The moment I get out of it.  Oh  I feel the light flooding in. I wanna be myself  I don't care . Even if it's still strange  Just don't care . As soon as I broke away from you  I can see myself. Everything  all before my eyes. Now I know  Now I know . The one I needed has been me. I walk as my feet take me. I feel the light  I feel the light. I was afraid of letting go of you. But I had to let go of you. It's all good now.

56,anotherday,I washed my tired body. And turned on the boring TV again. The dull news is going on and on. About something again today. What was most important to do . There was so much I wanted to do. But I kept being chased by time. There are so many places in this world. But I can't find a place. To rest comfortably anywhere near me. Even if I lay down and stretch out my legs. My eyes won't close. Even if I force them shut. I have a dreamless sleep. Whenever I wake up  my breathing is short. And my brain's hazy for a bit. There's another meaningless day. And at the end I repeat this again  yeah. Endless fights. Endless sighs. And drawn out yawns. My nerves are on edge  my words are knives. I'm sick of it all. When I pushed my way into this dark room. Did anybody bother to look back at me . I barely managed to make it through this hard day. How many times did I smile  and were they genuine smiles . I find the way I'm trapped in my thoughts funny. I'm still so young  but I have so many worries. Just do what you're supposed to be doing well. Nobody knows anything about how empty my heart feels. And I hate how. All they know how to do is laugh it off. Even if I lay down and stretch out my legs. My eyes won't close. Even if I force them shut. I have a dreamless sleep. Whenever I wake up  my breathing is short. And my brain's hazy for a bit. There's another meaningless day. And at the end I repeat this again  yeah. Is everyone but me happy  I really want to know. Or am I just a kid who doesn't know how to hide it yet . Everyone hides it behind their masks. And become numb to the word 'loneliness' bit by bit. 
57,phobia,Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. The figure of you facing the wavering sky. Can I get a little closer to you today . But somehow I'm anxious  afraid of you getting farther away. Ah  I'm usually not like this though. The thoughts inside my head are all tangled. It's too much  I can't think of anything else. Don't know why I'm like this. Even when I act like nothing's wrong. My heart's racing like it's about to burst. Stay with me. Don't hesitate anymore. Don't hesitate. There's no use in talking. Because just being in front of you. I'm stuck with a phobia. I want to stay together with you. I'm stuck with a phobia. I can't go there  the place where you're at. I can't get closer. Oh oh oh oh. Why am I like this  Oh I don't know either. Oh oh oh oh. I'm trapped  in the phobia of you. It's so overwhelming to hold you in my arms. I cherish you again and again but it's not enough. A person so precious  you're so radiant. The brighter you shine. The more I tremble. This shake of anxiety turns into flutter of excitement. And at the moment it changed  I come closer. At the thought of making you laugh. This tremor feeling  I'm having fun with it now. Don't know why I'm like this. Even though I act cool. My heart's racing like it's about to burst. Stay with me. Don't hesitate anymore. Don't hesitate. There's no use in talking. Because just being in front of you. I'm stuck with a phobia. I want to stay together with you. I'm stuck with a phobia. I can't go there  the place where you're at. I can't get closer. Oh oh oh oh. Why am I like this  Oh I don't know either. Oh oh oh oh. I'm trapped  in the phobia of you. The moment I get to meet you. Is getting closer and closer  I'm nervous  I'm nervous. The cheers getting louder in my head. Thinking if I could treat you well. I confidently shout. I know full well this chance will only come once. So I'll do anything for you. So that you can believe in me. I'm stuck with a phobia. I want to stay together with you. I'm stuck with a phobia. I can't go there  the place where you're at. I can't get closer. Oh oh oh oh. Why am I like this  Oh I don't know either. Oh oh oh oh. I'm trapped  in the phobia of you.

61,topkoreanversion,Tell me. What do you think our limit is . People are asking how far we will go. Instead of an answer  we'll show them our place. That is created by the continuous challenges. Don't know where the end is  have no choice but to keep going. Yeah  when they say it's impossible. We'll rely on each other even more and get through it together. Even if the future is bleak  I'll keep running. Countless fights  I won't ever back down  I have to see the end. As I look at the stairs. That pierce the sky till the end. I wonder if I can even climb it  I'm getting anxious. But I can't avoid this journey. Till I can't breathe and I faint. I'll keep running with my all. Never let you go  never let you go. Till the faint light becomes bright  I go. No turning back. Go up. No turning back. Lift up your head  look up. Go up. Never let you go  never let you go. Till the faint light becomes bright  I go. I already gave it my all. I already shed all fear. So even if you try to block me  I'll pierce right through you. I'm taking one more step up. To find the dream that I want. Woo. I know that the more time passes. The harder it'll get. But no matter how hard it is. No matter how much it brings me down. No matter how much bloody sweat I shed  I know that I can win. As I look at the stairs. That pierce the sky till the end. I wonder if I can even climb it  I'm getting anxious. But I can't avoid this journey. Till I can't breathe and I faint. I'll keep running with my all. Never let you go  never let you go. Till the faint light becomes bright  I go. No turning back. Go up. No turning back. Lift up your head  look up. Go up. Never let you go  never let you go. Till the faint light becomes bright  I go. Get up again  even if you fall  keep going. Keep solving the problems that come. Where is the end  Is there is answer to this top . Just open the next door with the key in your hands. When your mind is frozen over yet another hurdle. Just move in perfect order  I'm betting on myself. The more I go up  the faster my breathing gets. In my empty head. Only my dream to reach the top remains. No turning back. Don't let go. No turning back. Lift up your head  look up. Go up. I'm gonna run without rest. Not looking to the side or to the back. Never let you go  never let you go. Till the faint light becomes bright  I go.

We go. Wherever Imma fly all day. Where should I go Maybe I wanna go somewhere. I'll go to any place where I can rest. Whether it's a house or outside it doesn't matter just chillin'. Throwing away the yesterday that was full of worries. Want to go find the paradise the light shone on. With no rush  just searching for it effortlessly. My steps exude the fact that I'm relaxed. Whether I'm running or crawling  there's nothing that I'm scared of. Just looking around at the scenery. Seoul to Busan  while looking I walk. My left hand holding a cup of Americano. And when I get gloomy  I just casually leave. Flying overseas  beyond Korea. MonTueWedThurSatSun with no day off I just keep going. Staying up wondering where I'll go today. Oh Imma run far. Wherever I go I don't pay no mind. We go. Flying anywhere. We go. Wherever Imma fly all day. Oh Imma run far. Wherever I go I don't pay no mind. We go. Flying anywhere. We go. Wherever Imma fly all day. Beyond domestic  going worldwide. Reaching their hands out to me. Instead of earth  I'm travelling in the galaxy. I should learn the alien's language. Habada  Hamanana. Gabada  Gamanana. ET translates what I just said .  Hello  it's nice to meet you  . I don't really take pictures. But now that I have a lot of places to go it's my hobby. Taking pictures as a memento wherever I go.  One  two  three   and Binnie smile blooms. Thought of beanie since you went Binnie Binnie. Beanie on a cold day is a must. Taking  feeling  and tasting in the things I see on movies firsthand.  D's getting boring  so I should have fun. I just want a lot of things by nature. Don't wanna waste time so I say sorry to my sleep. I don't whine  having lots of things to do. I don't justify myself  having lots of things to do. I don't make excuses  having lots of things to do. Instead  I brag everywhere about my schedule. Oh Imma run far. Wherever I go I don't pay no mind. We go. Flying anywhere. We go. Wherever Imma fly all day. Oh Imma run far. Wherever I go I don't pay no mind. We go. Flying anywhere. We go. Wherever Imma fly all day. Oh Imma run far. Wherever I go I don't pay no mind. We go.

85,sorryiloveyou,Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for liking you. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. If liking you is wrong. Sorry that I like you so much  I'm sorry. I tried to hide my feelings  but I guess it was too obvious. I'm sorry  I'm sorry. That I like you. I can't  I can't hide my feelings for you anymore. I bravely take a step closer to you. But this step was never easy. I made up my mind long ago  but I still needed more time. But maybe I took too long. Our timings were off  I feel like I'm being punished. What I did to get closer to you was rather. Building a wall between us  I'm speechless. I blame myself  I blame you. I don't know whom to blame  my resent grows. Trying to break down the wall between us just breaks my heart. While making my mind up  I missed the most important one  you. When I gave you a movie ticket  you were just so happy. But now I'm unintentionally pressuring you. I just wanted to be with you  the two of us  together. The tickets were just an excuse. To be just friends. You're too beautiful. To just stay as friends. I know I'll regret  so I end this. I know I'll regret  so I decide to express my feelings. I want to be more than just friends. I like you too much. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for liking you. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. If liking you is wrong. Sorry that I like you so much  I'm sorry. I tried to hide my feelings  but I guess it was too obvious. I'm sorry  I'm sorry. That I like you. I try to hide this feeling that I can't control. I get carried away by this feeling that I can't control. With you being so irresistibly charming. I should have looked away. Yet I'm mesmerized again. The time waiting for you. Feels like waiting for a traffic signal at a four way street. The fact that we've grown even further apart than we were. Makes me weary. Because of my honesty  there is no relief. All that remains is regret. To be just friends. You're too beautiful. To just stay as friends. I know I'll regret  so I end this. I know I'll regret  so I decide to express my feelings. I want to be more than just friends. I like you too much. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for liking you. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. If liking you is wrong. Sorry that I like you so much  I'm sorry. I tried to hide my feelings  but I guess it was too obvious. I'm sorry  I'm sorry. That I like you. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for liking you. Sorry that I like you  I'm sorry. If liking you is wrong. Sorry that I like you so much  I'm sorry. I tried to hide my feelings  but I guess it was too obvious. I'm sorry  I'm sorry. That I like you.

99,maniac,Let's go. Relax everyone  stop pretending to be normal. All of your smiles look weird. When the Lock is released  we're all the same. Your eyes can't fool me  ho. The real self has been released. Barely holding on. After blinking once  back. Again  back to cosplaying as what. Society defines normal to be ppow. Mash up  mind blown put my mind on back up. Prototype  on the inside I'm always a freaky monster. Kindness is no longer trending  now rotten. You can backbite me as much as you want. I'll ignore them anyway. Poppin'. If you think I'm just pure and innocent  you're wrong. When a favor continues  people think it's their right  toxic. This is what drives me crazy  warning. MANIAC. Going crazy  like I have a loose screw MANIAC. Spinning  going crazy. MANIAC Walk like Frankenstein. MANIAC MANIAC Haha. MANIAC  Oh . Laugh like I have a loose screw MANIAC.  You can't stop the smoke . Spinning  going crazy  Thick as fog . MANIAC a MANIAC group.  We're MANIACS . MANIAC MANIAC. Like the seam of a torn doll. Eventually  you'll expose your real self. In this not easy life. It ain't  live  it's  holding on  yeah. Relax everyone  stop pretending to be normal. All of your smiles no fresh. When the Locket is open  we're all the same. Your eyes can't fool me  ho. This street I'm walking on is a minefield. Like a dormant volcano  never know when it'll all explode. Never know when the calm winds will change. Everyone lives hiding themselves like a sealed tornado. Poppin'. If you think I'm just pure and innocent  you're wrong. When a favor continues  people think it's their right  toxic. This is what drives me crazy  warning. MANIAC. Going crazy  like I have a loose screw MANIAC. Spinning  going crazy. MANIAC Walk like Frankenstein. MANIAC MANIAC Haha. MANIAC  Oh . Laugh like I have a loose screw MANIAC.  You can't stop the smoke . Spinning  going crazy  Thick as fog . MANIAC a MANIAC group.  We're MANIACS . MANIAC MANIAC. Eyes filled with lunatic. All senses are tense. Locked up while wrapped up in that pretty package. As time goes by  it'll eventually be revealed. The inner self that was hidden yeah. MANIAC. MANIAC  MANIAC . MANIAC. MANIAC MANIAC. You cannot stop with this feeling. MANIAC  Oh . Laugh like I have a loose screw MANIAC.  You can't stop the smoke . Spinning  going crazy  Thick as fog . MANIAC a MANIAC group.

I don't want to show you  I'm weak and I'm out of shape. For those who relied on me  this is a contradiction. Pretending to be strong and not sick. I just want to be a force for someone. You can't let me take their strength out of you. I don't have the courage to put a question mark on the words  I can expect it . The pain grows silently trapped in a room without a door to go out. I was so tired of being patient. I'm still gonna be able to handle it. The band on the wound eventually falls. I've been on it in a hurry  but it's not long before I get back on it. The rain that builds up on the roof that has been torn down. I know so well that I repeat it. I need someone  I need someone to get. Ask me again  is it okay  Anybody. Like a streetlight. Like a streetlight. In the middle of a lonely night. I just look bright. After the end of a lonely day. And you're gonna stand there. In the middle of a lonely night. And try to smile brightly. I can't rely on anything. Choose to rely on myself. And now that I'm shaking  I'm. Who the hell should I catch . I'm not gonna let you know. My shoulder is more drooping than that. I can't tell you everything I can't tell you. The pain that I can not shake off. Blame myself. I'm gonna breathe in the murky air. I gasp  like I'm going to be out of breath beyond the unpleasantness. I don't care what's not. Nothing is okay. I don't see the way around me. I feel stingy. Will the hidden look be revealed for a moment . I'm afraid  I'm afraid . Like a streetlight. Like a streetlight. After the end of a lonely day. I'm standing in the air. In the middle of a lonely night. And try to smile brightly. Like that streetlight. Like a streetlight. In the middle of a lonely night. I just look bright. After the end of a lonely day. And you're gonna stand there. In the middle of a lonely night. And try to smile brightly. Like a streetlight. Like a streetlight. In the middle of a lonely night. I just look bright. After the end of a lonely day. And you're gonna stand there. In the middle of a lonely night. And try to smile brightly.

Everyone just follows along with others' reactions making a clamor. Divide this one failure into two. My emotions are profound  like they're all a fusion. I lower my head once and let them out. Tying down my vigor again with rope. Until my battery runs dry and dies. My memory's full of lyrics  I'm a magazine. I've gotta be on the front cover. I'm the type who made it on my own  might as well be an idol rapper. Salary doesn't matter. I pay for my tracks filled with my passion. I'm on my grind  my brain already filled with ideas  full with the amount of work I get done. Whoo look what I got. I pick up a fallen persimmon and eat it. Raising my level  I hit one hunnit. Then accelerate to walk on the top. I use my spot in the center to gain momentum. I'm gonna get the top bish. And you're under me cleaning up my scraps for a clean dish. Sicker than you. Bigger than you. Trying to snap off with nothing more that B listers. You getting worked up over nothing sounds like a bunch of dogs trying to eat grass. Out here handing out your undignified nagging. But I turn it all down because it's useless  don't need it at all. Shut your trap 'cause it stinks  everyone back off already. I'll clear up this whole round  get out of the way  be patient  adrenaline. I rise up high  God God  I'm going higher  God God . Keep on whining because my answer is I got it  I got it. Shut your trap 'cause it stinks  everyone back off already. I'll clear up this whole round  get out of the way  be patient  adrenaline. I rise up high  God God  I'm going higher  God God . Keep on whining because my answer is I got it  I got it. What do you want 'cause I'm worn out every day  man. Doing my best to enlighten you all on the things you come say to me. But who said the finger pointing would stop . Filled with rich emotions  I'm an emotional man. It looks like the only thing on your noble pedestals is shit  not divine favor. Another  another  I'm of a different class  'til the end of my life my luck's gonna last. No need to rush  I keep my own pace taking my time  waking up in my studio. Like a butterfly  letting my wings dry before taking flight. Stop wishing you had my talent that gives my interesting life a rich air. 'Cause I'm getting tired of dealing with your leftovers. Every time I make a miracle. Cutting you off sharply  yes I'm a scissor. I won't lower my head to your damn attacks  let 'em rain down 'cause I'm not scared of your pointing fingers. I'm not a kid I won't be ashamed  I take on dangerous challenges to create something even more amazing. I'm greedy  trying everything and even taking your plate 'cause in the end I won't lose a thing. Shut your trap 'cause it stinks  everyone back off already. I'll clear up this whole round  get out of the way  be patient  adrenaline. I rise up high  God God  I'm going higher  God God . Keep on whining because my answer is I got it  I got it. Shut your trap 'cause it stinks  everyone back off already. I'll clear up this whole round  get out of the way  be patient  adrenaline. I rise up high  God God  I'm going higher  God God . Keep on whining because my answer is I got it  I got it. Hello  isn't that a bit too fast . It's 'cause you suck when you rap slowly. You're hurting my ears with your constant loud bragging. I'm sick of you now    you're a star  in my heart.

But there was nothing I could do. Couldn't even laugh. That star. I hope my voice reaches to that star. No matter how much I scream. You have no idea how beautiful you were. I wanted to tell you everything. For you to see and laugh. You were very smart. And I thought you would remember all the pain. The tears won't stop. The thought that  I shouldn't have met you in the first place . I hated myself for thinking crazily like that. I'm sorry for wanting to hug you even now. That star. I hope my voice reaches to that star. No matter how much I scream. You have no idea how beautiful you were.

I was filled with excitement as I landed on a strange place at first. When my eyes became the dark night  my tears keep piling up. Since my confidence could be hated by someone. I survived like I have visited death but somehow I got left out alone. Even though I was with them in the same place  I was an alien. Landed from the universe but my lonely self just got filled with hurt. It's a lonely night  quiet night. It's so dark I use my low voice. It will come true  in between the stars.

I swear to myself I won't fall. There are countless dreams in the sky. Waiting for me so I don't care about depression. Right I have to live. If I fall  every thing will be ruined  even my dreams. Even my dream will be ruined. The breathe I have taken at this place. It was bitter and painful  but I can hold it in. Don't I want it for my dream . So no one wanted me. I was too young for everyone to like. As time passes  I became older. Although I'm imperfect  I'm proud of myself. It's a lonely night  quiet night. It's so dark I use my low voice. It will come true  in between the stars. I'm just lonely Someone please reach out for me and hold me. Fell on the earth I'm an alien on this earth. Feels like I don't fit in anywhere.

138,wishyouback,You were my story. Your word comes to mind endlessly. Just by being able to look at it. Like a photo that will be engraved deeply in my heart. I'll gather my memories one by one. And cherish them in my heart. Your scent became the wind and flew far away. I'll remember it forever. Because you're on my mind more today. My vision is slowly getting blurry. After a long time passes. I wonder if you'll. Gradually fade away from my mind. I still remember your warm touch. Put your small hands together and look back. In the days when every moment was beautiful and splendid. You were the main character in the movie called me. Yeah still rolling  you keep coming to my mind. Meaningless tears flow and keep holding me behind. I've been travelin' around the world. Guess what  even though I purposely try. To fill my mind with other thoughts. I can't get rid of it  it gets caught. You were my story. Your word comes to mind endlessly. Just by being able to look at it. Like a photo that will be engraved deeply in my heart.

Sometimes I'm gonna get hurt. But I'll call you until you come back. Let's go back to those times  our day day. To how it was  turn everything back back back. If anything can come back just by missing it  I don't know. It's not easy to explain how I feel. I sit in a room all day long and turn off the light. Don't bother asking if I'm okay. This feeling won't go away by such words. Watering a withered flower won't make it bloom again. Even the pinky finger that made the promise not to be defeated. All disappeared and crumbled after your goodbye. You were my story. Your word comes to mind endlessly. Just by being able to look at it. Like a photo that will be engraved deeply in my heart. I'll gather my memories one by one. And cherish them in my heart. Your scent became the wind and flew far away. I'll remember it forever. I'll wish you back. I just want you to stay with me all day. So baby love me again if it's okay. I'll wish you back. I'll wish you back. I'll wish you back. Sometimes I'm gonna get hurt. But I'll call you until you come back. Let's go back to those times  our day day. To how it was  turn everything back back back. Yeah I'm waitin' on you  still waiting on you. Perhaps I already know that you won't come. As I look at the faded picture of you and me. I can't help but be filled with regret. I want to end the endless darkness. And see your bright smile again. Waitin' on you  still waiting. Waitin' on you  I'm still waiting on you.

Ah la la  love you  baby. Ah la la  love you  baby. Ice to cream. Ice to cream. I see ice as a cream  babe. I think I know you but I don't  you have a sweet aftertaste. Harsh words mean nothing to me. With a few childish words  your expression as cold as ice disappears. And you become soft and pure. Because I like the way you are  I started my Love account book. I checked how much I spent today. As I made a loss  it ends in disappointment. But whenever you  who's cold  smile  like a. Ice to cream.  I see  Ice as a cream. Melts in a flash. I can't pull myself together. Ice to cream.  I see  Ice as a cream. After the breathtaking taste. Everything is just bitter. Ah la la  love you  baby. Ah la la  love you  baby. Ice to cream. Ice to cream. I see ice as a cream  babe. I'm already wrong. There's a set answer. An objective reply to a subjective question. Imagine falling into your dizzying charms. As someone who's fallen in love. It's a bit hard to explain while being blinded by love. I delude myself into thinking that. Someone who's cold to everyone is only warm to me. So baby what you what you want. If it's what you want  we can take a trip to somewhere near the galaxy. This may be an exaggeration  but there's nothing I can't do. If love is everything  there's nothing that's left for me. Lopsided affection. So familiar that there's no need to even review it. I'll just watch  I'll like you just a little bit. If a little doesn't work  I'll do it without letting you know. Ice to cream.  I see  Ice as a cream. Melts in a flash. I can't pull myself together. Ice to cream.  I see  Ice as a cream. After the breathtaking taste. Everything is just bitter. Ah la la  love you  baby. Ah la la  love you  baby. Ice to cream. Ice to cream. I see ice as a cream  babe.

149,scars,I'll never cry because I know that it'll never change. I'll stay standing and endure it in an unknown place. There will be many times I'll almost fall  but. Alone  I reach out my hand  alone  I stand back up. Worn out sneakers  worn out tee. I don't have time to heal my aching scars. This voice dying in front of the pop guard. All these scars are somehow like a tattoo. I'll bare it all. I'll show it all and. Even the days I want to throw away. I won't avoid it  no matter what happens. I don't care  let go  even if I collapse  even if I collapse. Until the dawn. I turn on the lights. That's right  I won't stop. It will still be bright ahead. Face towards the future. I will never give up. If it's me  it will be okay. I'll push forward. This hurt  Oh oh oh  oh oh . This won't change my heart. Even if it looks like it'll break. I'll aim for the limit of my strength  Oh oh oh  oh oh . Even if I fall  if it's me  it will be okay. I'll never cry because I know that it'll never change.

It's screaming in my chest  ooh woah oh  Ooh woah oh . There's probably someone watching. Someone who will heal this pain  yeah eh. Until the dawn. I turn on the lights. That's right  I won't stop. It will still be bright ahead. Face towards the future. I will never give up. If it's me  it will be okay. I'll push forward. This hurt  Oh oh oh  oh oh . This won't change my heart. Even if I shed more tears in the future. I'll tighten my fists  heading for tomorrow. I'll take back the smile that I had forgotten. Look up and walk  dazzlingly. My scars  I will show it all. This won't change my heart. Even if it looks like it'll break. I'll aim for the limit of my strength  Oh oh oh  oh oh . Even if I fall  if it's me  it will be okay.

That's much easier to show off  Shine like a diamond  'kay . Swerving. I'm speeding on serpent road. Luxurious like I'm an S class. Best of the best on first class. I'm up above the world  so high. I'll be there shining day and night. They wonder how my spotlight is so bright. Counting stars. The most special star  star  star  star  star  star. The odd one  that's me. All  all  all  all  all  all sorts of things are my work  Bling  bling . Everyday flashy  flashy. It's flashy  we're S class. Flashy  flashy. Light spreads  the star shines brighter. I feel like the brightest star  light floods in tonight. When I look up  my image is embroidered in the sky  yeah  yeah. Stick around in the same place  STAY  yeah. Shining people  that's our intro  we're special  yeah. Stray Kids  I've got special forces behind me. Being on stage  that itself is special already. We don't need an audience for the festival. No need for restrictions when letting things loose. Limited edition  what's unique becomes special. Make what's opaque clear  reflect upon it over and over again. Energy stands out  audience is immersed. Our light becomes one  lighting up every corner here. Counting stars S Class.  Counting stars S Class . Feeling extra  Bling  bling . Everyday flashy  flashy. It's flashy  we're S class. Flashy  flashy. Light spreads  the star shines brighter.

175,12345,Wanna fly high. The older I get. It all keeps slipping away  I'm carrying an increasingly high weight load. Seems like it might just work out  but then it's a dead end. I must be in a maze  I'm stuck. Inside my head  there's a traffic  red light. Fatigue is piling up  the maze has turned pitch black. Brake pedal  step on it  beep  beep  beep. If I don't stop now  I'll crash and just get mad  huff and puff. Pedal to the metal  but again  streak  streak. My words are crossed out with a line scratch  scratch. I ain't tryna fight  let me go. Running barefoot  getting scrapes and scratches on my toes. A runway under the sky that looks like it might fall. As the days go by  my shoulders drop lower to the ground. The time is tickin'  moving faster. Time goes by quickly. The moonlight shines past midnight until the next day. Everything is slipping through my fingers. Cynical  things are getting on my nerves. What a day  I'm like a criminal. Nobody seeks me. Let's count one  two  three  four  five. Time is ticking  and the numbers are changing. Only the small LED light flickers. Feels like ooh ooh  ooh ooh  ooh. Next comes six  seven  eight  and nine o'clock. The sun is flashing in the sky so bright. The days are getting longer. Feels like ooh ooh  ooh ooh  ooh ooh  ooh ooh  ooh. Oh  everybody dancing on the stage  not me. On a deserted island  I watch the party. Call yeah         I can't even breathe. Oh  everybody dancing on the stage  not me. On a deserted island  I watch the party. Call yeah         I can't even breathe. Who said  who said . I'll be okay  be okay. Don't say  don't say. I know it's all a lie  oh  please. No lie. Thought my life would be full of starlight  Starlight . For now. No more dreams  everything gets shut down  Mm . Every day is full of flurry. Every single day makes me go crazy  Crazy . Falling on the old faded sketchbook  the drops of rain  yeah  Oh oh . Teach me how to get my smile back. There aren't any clues  somebody help. I just can't wake up  so tired of this nightmare. The time is tickin'  moving faster. Time goes by quickly. The moonlight shines past midnight until the next day. Everything is slipping through my fingers. Cynical  things are getting on my nerves  Mm . What a day  I'm like a criminal. Nobody seeks me. Let's count one  two  three  four  five.

176,13,This happiness doesn't seem to be mine. I must let it go  send it far away. Nostalgic memories that last deep inside. They give me a headache. Like the rolling waves. The memories and words we shared wash over me again. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. The night I walked you home. My warm spring days. The day when thick mist filled the air. You were my universe. To do what's best for you  I denied myself. To me it was so perfectly right  but why. What are you sorry for  it was my own will and desire. I could give you my all and it still wouldn't be enough. During days when we were young and na ve  what we loved. Were your pure  clear eyes that gazed into you and me. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. The night I walked you home. My warm spring days. The day when thick mist filled the air. You were my universe. Oh oh  yeah. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh.

179,blackhole,In the dark night sky. I feel the empty space. The deep chasm between the two stars. That I found at last disappears. After everything crumbles down  another world is born. Shining brightly in front of my eyes. A whirlwind of time and space  the falling sky. Warmly surrounds and caresses me. I fall into you again. Into your heart. Leaving myself to gravity. I'm trapped in your space again. There's nothing I can do. The moment we touch each other amid the stardust. I know that baby you are the one. You and I  our hearts like the stars. Shine brightly for each other. The space that tears apart the night sky. We can't stop.  You  are my fate   I  am your mate. Swirling up the vast emptiness. We will shine. Ooh. Far away in the distance. You're shining in your place. I am drawn to you. And the blank space in that place. Is it a coincidence or is it meant to be . With you I step into this new world. As the two of us scatter apart. We are surrounded by even more brightness. I fall into you again. Into your heart. The way gravity leads me. I'm trapped in your space. And there's nothing I can do. The moment we touch each other amid the stardust. I know that baby you are the one. You and I  our hearts like the stars. Shine brightly for each other. The space that tears apart the night sky. We can't stop.  You  are my fate   I  am your mate. Swirling up the vast emptiness. We will shine.

Little wishes. I want to tell you. I'll always be there. I'm gonna stay. Next to you  closer to you. Still  always be there. I'm gonna stay. Drawing you in my dreams. I'll wait for you tonight. Always. And always  yeah. In my day. It was full of you. You blooms beautifully  when I close my eyes. I couldn't stop. My smile for you. Spreading out in the sky. Just like my heart that I can't hide. I'll always be there. I'm gonna stay. Next to you  closer to you. Still  always be there. I'm gonna stay. Drawing you in my dreams. I'll wait for you tonight. Days when I spent cold nights awake. I think about you every day. Like a warm light. You came to me. I'll always be there. I'm gonna stay. Next to you  closer to you. Still  always be there. I'm gonna stay. Drawing you in my dreams. I'll wait for you tonight. 
183,contradicting,Why is love so contradicting   Woah . I can't stop it  so addicting  Woah . Why is love so   Why is love so  . Why is love so   Why is love so  . The lights of our warm moments have grown dim. They float around and now sink in my head  we try to find the reason for us. To me  love is not  ayy  To me  love is not . Something that turns off instantly  ayy  Something that turns off instantly . I feel so dry  no matter how much water I drink. I helplessly swallow the night  Swallow the night . Hoping no one sees me  I pull the covers over me. And struggle to hold myself down and stay strong. For me  love does not have an expiration date. Even if I go back  I'll repeat the same mistake. Can't hide it  the chaos of honesty and lies. I loved you but the end is the same as everyone else. Why is love so contradicting   Woah . I can't stop it  so addicting  Woah . Why is love so   Why is love so  . Why is love so   yeah. Why is love so contradicting   Woah . I can't stop it  so addicting  Woah . Just fade away  Just fade away . Just get away  Just get away . It feels like I'm on a train running without a destination. The breeze we felt together has calmed down. The sunlight that felt like a blessing is only momentary. Your eyes are swallowed by the waves. Frost builds up in my cold heart. Can't hide it  even if I wipe it away it soon builds again. The promises we made have now. Turned into bubbles and disappear far away before my eyes  ayy. So I just wanna go back. Our time returns to a blank space again  yeah. Started out as a novel. But while writing the last chapter it ended up as poetry. Stories of memories are put behind. The paragraph about the goodbye is short but deep. Highlighted with sadness and freshness. The song I write with the tip of my finger  Crying all day . Why is love so contradicting   Woah . I can't stop it  so addicting  Woah . Just fade away  Just fade away . Just get away  Just get away . Why is love so contradicting   Woah . I can't stop it  so addicting  Woah . Just fade away  Just fade away . Just get away  Just get away . 
184,cypher,Soles of my shoes cracked  a stretched out tee. A band aid on my torn up knee would be a luxury. My vocal chords tear in front of the pop filter. These are all my wounds  my scars  they're my tattoo. I won't cover them   I'll show all I've got. I won't hide them   it's fine if they all show. The pains and failures that make you. Want to give it all up are just an excuse. I'll take it all  I'll ruin myself. When i ruin myself more. Knock knock  you you never want anything more than me being smart. I lose  lose it because no matter where you go they all say the same thing. They strike with their stinging words. Everything's taken as just acceptance  agreement  submission  or defiance. But we won't take it  our opinions and thoughts are like cutting scissors. Silence does nothing. The value of our learning here is nothing in front of the goals i hold. It dirties our lives. I won't unclench my fist. If what you mean by  teaching . Is telling me to quit then just kill me  kill me bang. Wanna be the gang. The moment you're faced with giving up your dream you've lost. Break away from the prejudice that we're sure to fail. I can show all the cards in my hand  I won't lose either way. Imma look back  Imma look back  Imma look back to the future in fact. My past dreams become reality and i awaken from my terrible nightmare. I woke and hit refresh to write out the things I want again. I whip myself with dissatisfaction  and that's what brought me here. I do it for my team  I do it for my fan. I keep making it past each and every level. I roll out a red carpet across Korea in front of my excited gait. Anything that gets in my way I just kill it  click clack chick chick bang. The idiots who want nothing more than thrills gather on thin ice. I don't bother voicing my complaints out and around. Just in front of myself and how I'm dissatisfied now. It's been a while since I found a seat i wanted to be my own. There won't be any way to avoid some blood. I have always wanted more  if I didn't how could I get anything . I want more and more  I need it all to be satisfied. Even if I can't pick the stars from the sky I need to at least make it up there. If I make it and fall like a shooting star I still know i started from the bottom. No matter what others think of me  that's what makes me what I want to be. Fine  keep ignoring me  that's exactly what will make me scarier for you. Cross mountain after mountain. River after river  just cross it all. Cross the mountain to the range  the river to the sea. I make it past it all and see what's next. They say low expectations means you can't be disappointed. But i have high expectations for everything. I shoot my expecations knowing I'll make a goal. I won't ever accept a miss. I'll win     of     battles.      exploding potential. I spit in the face of retreat with my spirit and bravery. I'll win     of     battles. I burn my passion. I never learned to fear failure. I'm so confident it's overflowing. I'm certain I'll make it so I set up my dream.

That I call you. Is it a shining sea or. Should it be my world . If I close my eyes. Ringing in my ears. Your faint waves come into my dreams. Spread full. I'm still here always. At every stop. I miss you  by your side. Always in the same place  by your side. I stay here always. In my heart it became clear. A little closer  by my side. With your smile by my side. Here always. Always. Ooh  ooh ooh  ooh. I'll call your name. Like the sunlight. That has just approached.

Overlapped with the seasons. The night's so cold that it's almost unreal. I wake up in another silence. And I close my eyes. The white flower we planted together has bloomed. I do not dare pick it. Now it withers away. So I long for you. And I long for you. And I'll long for you. So I can keep loving you. So I could be loving you. And more.

Wondering how your smile will brighten and make me laugh this time. I'll protect you it's okay to hurt. I'll embrace the wounds you shed. To me  you're already a sin. I can't refuse because you're sweeter than evil. You can burst into flames  you can wound me next to you. If you like  I can be anything. Yeah  you can hurt me  I don't care  yeah  you can burn me. Unlike those who run away from you  I'll embrace you. Like a volcano. Love at a temperature that can melt when touched. Take me to you  way below to the end of the ground. It's okay if everything burns down. Even if I go back hundreds of times  my choice is always. I can't live without you you're the only one  even if I die. Even if I'm reborn over and over again  it's only you. I want to give only to you my heart is burning. When I'm thinking of you  my mind is. Like a volcano. Love at a temperature that can melt when touched. Take me to you  way below to the end of the ground. It's okay if everything burns down. Even if I go back hundreds of times  my choice is always. So I can melt into you. Hug my body even if it hurts  it's okay.  Woah  Among the cold and harsh waves. I need your heat you are my volcano.

212,happy,I have no more chances. So I feel sad right now. You make me cry hey. How about you . Are you happy out there. Even if I'm not by your side  I hope you live happily. I'm so glad to see you. In my dream hope you smile with me even for a moment. So that even without you  I can feel. Please be happy out there forever. Hope you always shine with that pretty smile. You were beautiful till the end. Stupid me is all that remains here. Should have treated you better back then. After saying these obvious words I give out long sigh. I want to rewind time and start all over already. Reorganize this chaotically destroyed situation. And go back to the time when I was happy but it's too far away. My mind has changed. I didn't smile and all emotions turned cold. I couldn't go back. As you talk to me sadly  I rather comfort you. That everything happens naturally. This is never your fault so don't cry. Don't shed tears and like those times. Smile  because you're the prettiest when you smile. What if I hold onto you again. Could we go back to those times. Are you happy out there. Even if I'm not by your side  I hope you live happily. I'm so glad to see you. In my dream hope you smile with me even for a moment. So that even without you  I can feel. Please be happy out there forever. Hope you always shine with that pretty smile. I want you to come back to me babe. I want you to come back to me babe. You  pictured in the photos  are still so bright. Stupid me still draws you in the air. A star called you shines in the pitch dark room. Blinded by this light I still miss you. What if I hold onto you again. Can we go back to those times. Are you happy out there. Even if I'm not by your side  I hope you live happily. I'm so glad to see you. In my dream hope you smile with me even for a moment. So that even without you  I can feel. Please be happy out there forever. Hope you always shine with that pretty smile. I want you to come back to me babe. I want you to come back to me babe. 
213,allmylifestraykidsremix,All my life  I've been runnin' alone. Space and time  I see them come and go. Been fighting from the low  from the low. The pressure takes me to the top. Sticks and stones  yeah  just keep 'em up  ayy. Finna reach what they just cannot touch  Cannot touch . Broken bones  yeah  I pick 'em up  ayy. Shed a tear to make me never stop  never stop. 'Cause I've been doin' this. All my life  All my life . They been tryin' to keep me down  They been tryna keep me down . All this time  All this time . Never thought I would make it out  Never thought I'd make it out . They couldn't break me  they couldn't break me  No  no . They couldn't take me  they couldn't take me  No . All my life  All my life . They been tryin' to keep me down  They been tryna keep me down . I decided I had to finish. But the media called me a menace. I done sat with the mayor and politicians  I'm tryna change the image. You can't blame my past no more  I come from the trenches. Some said I'd never be a superstar  but I know I'm different  No  no  no . I'm The Voice  but the system ain't give me a choice. Know some people that's still unemployed. I know a felon who tryna get FOID. Child support your only support. For a visit  I'm goin' through courts. Went to jail  they was chainin' me up. And you know that I'm famous as fuck. See how you gon' joke about stimulus . But they really had came in the clutch. I know some kids wanna hurt theyself. Stop tryna take drugs  I refer to myself. Tryna better myself  tryna better my health but. All my life  All my life . They been tryin' to keep me down  They been tryna keep me down . All this time  All this time . Never thought I would make it out  Never thought I'd make it out . They couldn't break me  they couldn't break me  No  no . They couldn't take me  they couldn't take me  No . All my life  All my life . They been tryin' to keep me down  They been tryna keep me down . Despite the dissuasion  I go into the water. Their mistakes of saying it wouldn't work out for me. Now  even then  I focus on my actions. The image of me floating on the surface of the water you saw is oil  not foam. When a big wave comes  ride on top of it. My name will stand higher. Ain't nobody can stop talkin' about it.  i   topic. It's meaningless because I'm going on my own way anyway. Now  I'm just walking. The culprit from the past who tried to drown me underwater. The hardships that became a drizzle  became an anchor for my will. What can I do   Do . Like a cartoon  as if a cartoon . I found the clue in a high dimensional reality. In my life that was a blank color  that's blue  Yeah . I started to smell a little too like an adult  I saw it . Wiped away my tears after experiencing failure. It was my trophy  to keep going  Let's go . I'm confident in the place where we held hands. The more times like this  the more I bow my head and calm down. Now I'm at the edge. A cliff like railing that I don't want to go back to again. We rise more  I like this song. Nobody can judge us  go back from. There is no failure in this part of a story. I've relieved my thirst with blood and sweat. All my life  All my life . They been tryin' to keep me down  They been tryna keep me down . All this time  All this time . Never thought I would make it out  Never thought I'd make it out . They couldn't break me  they couldn't break me  No  no . They couldn't take me  they couldn't take me  No . All my life  All my life . They been tryin' to keep me down  They been tryna keep me down . 
214,destiny,Was our meeting a coincidence . No  I believe it was destiny. If we meet again after a long detour. I'll embrace you without a word. My clumsy love may hurt you. But as long as I have you  even if it takes a bit longer. Even if my time stops and my life ends. I am yours  it is destiny. The one who loved me. Even if your heart changes as time passes. I will love you more. Please stay by my side. Like the wind passing by. Do you see me between the seasons . If we are meant to meet again  like destiny. Never let go of my hand this time. The past times may hurt us. But in this cold world  as long as I have you. Even if my time stops and my life ends. I am yours  it is destiny. The one who loved me. Even if your heart changes as time passes. I will love you more. Please stay by my side. In the unknowable times  when you smile at me. This moment will become eternal  being together by our side. Saying you are everything to me. The promise to always be together. Never forget it. Like dreaming  in this place where we meet again. Even when I close my eyes  more vividly. You come to my mind. I bloom again and embrace you. I will love you more. Here  where we meet again.
